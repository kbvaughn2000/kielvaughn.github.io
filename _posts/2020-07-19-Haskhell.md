Haskhell is a medium difficulty box from [TryHackme](https://www.tryhackme.com). Below are the steps involved to fully compromise this box.

First, let's see what ports are open by running **threader3000** and entering the IP address of our victim.

Next, let's run **nmap -A -p 22,5001 [machine ip]** to further enumerate these ports to see what is running. We ran threader first as it is able to find open TCP ports quickly, which in turn allows us to narrow the range that nmap is scanning, which speeds up its runtime as well.

It appears that port 5001 is hosting a web server. Let's open that up and take a look around.

![Haskhell web page](/assets/img/Haskhell3.png)

This page appears to be a professor's site for students to submit their assignments. Following the links eventually gets you to an upload page that does not appear to be functioning or there.

![Haskhell upload](/assets/img/Haskhell4.png)

Let's enumerate the website by running **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip]:5001 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt -t 50**

![Haskhell gobuster](/assets/img/Haskhell5.png)

It appears that it found another directory named **/submit**. Let's take a look at that in our browser.

![Haskhell submit](/assets/img/Haskhell6.png)

This appears to be the page where you are allowed to submit your assignments. I was able to upload a [PHP reverse shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell), but there was no indication of where the file was saved. I decided to go review the initial web page again, and noticed something I had overlooked previously.

Clicking on the link to the first assignment also tells you that only Haskell files are accepted for uploads. It also tells you where the files are uploaded to (the uploads directory)

With this information, I looked into ways to pull information off of a Linux system with a Haskell file. After a bit of research, I was able to find a sample for displaying contents of a file with a Haskell script [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/input-and-output).

![Haskhell sample Haskell code](/assets/img/Haskhell10.png)

I copied this code and modified it to display /etc/passwd instead, so we could enumerate users on the system.

![Haskhell haskell.hs](/assets/img/Haskhell11.png)

Next, I went back to the **/submit** page and uploaded the file to see what would happen.

![Haskhell /etc/passwd](/assets/img/Haskhell12.png)

Awesome, we were able to enumerate the users on the system. Let's modify this script to attempt to display both **/home/flask/user.txt** and **/home/prof/user.txt** to get the user flag.

![Haskhell script v2](/assets/img/Haskhell14.png)

This provided me with the user flag, which appeared to be under the **prof** user's home directory

![Haskhell user.txt](/assets/img/Haskhell15.png)

I also attempted this with root/root.txt, which received an access denied error. Going back to the initial scanning, I realized that ssh was open. Let's see if either of these users have a SSH key available.
![Haskhell retrieve ssh keys](/assets/img/Haskhell16.png)

![Haskhell prof SSH key](/assets/img/Haskhell17.png)

Awesome, the **prof** user has an SSH key. Let's save that to a file on our attacker computer named **prof.key**, and run **chmod 600 prof.key** on that key. 

![Haskhell save prof.key](/assets/img/Haskhell18.png)

Next, we need to crack this file with john to retrieve the key's password. This is done by running **python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py prof.key > prof.hash**.

This will tell you that this key does not have a password. Great!

![Haskhell private key no password](/assets/img/Haskhell20.png)

Let's connect as prof with **ssh -i prof.key prof@[machine ip]**. You should now have an ssh connection as prof.

![Haskhell prof SSH connection](/assets/img/Haskhell21.png)

Running **sudo -l** lets you know that prof can run flask as root.

![Haskhell prof sudo -l](/assets/img/Haskhell22.png)

Great, we should be able to obtain a root shell with a relatively simple python script. Let's run **nano shell.py** and put in the code shown in the screenshot below.

![Haskhell python script](/assets/img/Haskhell23.png)

Now, let's run **sudo /usr/bin/flask run**. We end up getting an error stating that there is not a FLASK_APP environment variable.

![Haskhell run flask](/assets/img/Haskhell24.png)

Let's set a FLASK_APP environment variable with **export FLASK_APP=/home/prof/shell.py**.

![Haskhell FLASK_APP env variable](/assets/img/Haskhell25.png)

Now, let's run **sudo /usr/bin/flask run** again and see what happens.

![Haskhell root shell](/assets/img/Haskhell26.png)

We now have root access! Let's run **cat /root/root.txt** to complete this box
