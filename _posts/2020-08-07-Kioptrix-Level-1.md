[Kioptrix](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/) Level 1 is a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used **netdiscover -i eth0** until I came across the IP of this machine.

This allowed me to figure out the IP address of the box, next I ran **threader3000** on this machine to enumerate the reports. I also allowed it to run its recommended nmap scan upon competion.

It appears that this is running Samba and an older version of Apache. Let's start by looking to see if Apache is vulnerable to an exploit. Searching on Google for **apache 1.3.20 exploit** will show a GitHub page to something called OpenLuck, which is an updated version of OpenFuck

Follow the directions on the page to download and compile this application.

Ironically, the version of Apache that is vulnerable is the one mentioned under step 5, but let's run **./OpenFuck** and take a look at the full list of versions this can exploit. Down the list are two for Apache 1.3.20 labeled **0x6a** and **0x6b**.

Running **./OpenFuck 0x6a [machine ip] 443 -c 40** does not work, however, **./OpenFuck 0x6b [machine ip] 443 -c 40** seems to work.

Success, we have a root shell. Next, I ran **/bin/sh -i** to get a better shell and then I ran **find / -name "\*flag\*" 2>/dev/null** to look for flags.

Unfortunately this did not return anything useful. Next I decided to look at each user's mail to see if the flag was present there (as that is another common method for CTF challenges). To do this, I ran **cd /var/mail** and ran **ls -al**.

It appears that root has mail, as the file size is greater than 0 bytes. I ran **cat root** and we found the flag!
