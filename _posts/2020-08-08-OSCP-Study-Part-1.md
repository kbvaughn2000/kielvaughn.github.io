I recently decided to start working on studying for the OSCP exam, as even though I've heard mixed things about the exam, it is still considered the de facto Penetration Testing certification as of the time of this post.

I came across <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0">NetSecFocus'</a> list of VMs on Vulnhub, and decided to start working on them and making writeups.

My goal was to complete all of these myself without looking up any walkthroughs or looking for hints. Essentially, my plan is to "try harder" so I feel confident to take on this certification.

Below is the list of machines I am planning to complete. The ones marked with a check have been completed and will be followed by the date completed.

My goal is to complete these rooms over the next 120 days, and see if I feel prepared to take on the OSCP material and examination at that point. My plan is to provide updates once a month along with my thoughts on these boxes.
