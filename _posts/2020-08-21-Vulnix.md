[HackLAB: Vulnix](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hacklab-vulnix,48/) a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used **netdiscover -i eth0** until I came across the IP of this machine.

Next, I ran **threader3000** to let is enumerate the open ports. I also let it run it's recommended nmap scan.

As you can see, there were several ports open. I looked into seeing how I could exploit SMTP first. It appears we can run **VRFY** on SMTP, which we can use to enumerate users. I ran **smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/smtp-usernames.txt -t [machine  ip]** to start enumeration. I used [this](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/yaptest/blob/master/smtp-usernames.txt) list of SMTP usernames for enumeration.

As you can tell, several users came back. I next used finger and was able to determine two users **root** and **user**. This was done by running **finger [username]@[machine ip]**

At this point, I had a couple of usernames to go off of, so I decided to attempt to brute force the user SSH credentials (as I felt the root ones were likely secure as it would make this box pointless otherwise). I ran **hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt [machine ip] -t 4 ssh** and after about 15 minutes the user account password was cracked as shown below.

I tried **sudo -l**, but user was not able to run sudo commands. I next ran **cd /home** followed by **ls -al** to enumerate the home users folder, and there was another user directory present, **vulnix**. I ran **id vulnix** to attain more information about its user id.

Next, I decided to attempt to remotely connect to the victim PC over NFS. In order to do so, I create da vulnix user on my attacker machine with the same ID # with **useradd -u 2008 vulnix**. I then created a folder to mount the target machine to with **mkdir /tmp/vulnix**. Finally, I mounted the /home/vulnix directory on the target machine to /tmp/vulnix on my attacker machine with **mount -t nfs [machine ip]:/home/vulnix /tmp/vulnix -nolock**.

I then ran **cd /tmp/vulnix** followed by **ls -al** and I was able to see the vulnix user's home directory

You can use SSH to connect two ways, with a password or with a certificate. I decided to generate a new set of SSH keys on my attacker pc as root with **ssh-keygen** after opening a new terminal window.

Next, I ran **cd /root/.ssh** followed by **ls** to ensure the files were generated. I then ran **cat id_rsa.pub** to get the contents for root's public key, which I copied.

Back on my victim session over NFS, I ran **mkdir .ssh** followed by **cd .ssh** and finally **touch authorized_keys**. This was going to be the file I pasted in my root public SSH key to.

In order to do so, I ran **vi authorized_keys** and pasted in the key value. Once completed, I pressed escape, and entered **:wq!** to write to the authorized_keys file and quit vi.

Now, back on my attacker PC, I ran **ssh vulnix@[machine ip]**. I was now connected as the vulnix user!

![Vulnix ssh vulnix](/assets/img/Vulnix14.png)

I ran **sudo -l**, which showed that vulnix could run **sudoedit /etc/exports** as root with no password.

![Vulnix vulnix sudo -l](/assets/img/Vulnix15.png)

This showed that the /home/vulnix directory had root_squash set, which disallows mounting NFS as root. I modified this to **no_root_squash** as shown below and added in **/root   \*(rw,no_root_squash)** as well, which should allow access to the **/root folder**.

Next, I rebooted the system in VMWare as recommended in the official creator's writeup (as I couldn't find another way to reboot the system). This allows the NFS changes to take place shown above. Next, I ran **umount /tmp/vulnix** to unmount the /home/vulnix nfs share and then ran **mount -t nfs [machine ip]:/root /tmp/vulnix** to mount the **/root** folder to the share. I then ran **cd /tmp/vulnix** followed by **ls** and the flag file, trophy.txt is present. I finished this box by running **cat trophy.txt**.
